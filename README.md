### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It's dÃ©von, a developer in growing. I'm originally from Qinghai.China but have spent few years working and living in Peking.

I'm passionate about design & UX in Mobile Applications especially, and love spending my free time on Youtube, etc. When I'm not doing that, you can usually find me on Twitter, Weibo and so on.

Professionally, I've worked in software-developing for 2 years around now, and have gained a lot of experience in coding. I'm currently working on coding based on Java, which I'm really excited about.

In terms of personality, I'm positive, responsible, and introverted. I try to approach everything with a positive attitude and am always looking for ways to improve myself and those around me.

I'm really looking forward to getting to know all of you better, and hope we can all learn and grow together!
